On March 13, 2025, the US Senate Banking Committee passed the Guiding  and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act of 2025 or “GENIUS  Act,” out of committee by a vote of 18-6.  
The legislation would establish for the first time a  comprehensive regulatory framework for the issuance and regulation of payment  stablecoins in the United States. Due to the strong bipartisan vote the bill  received in committee, the bill is well positioned to be approved by the full  Senate. Further, US House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill (R-AR)  has already signaled his intention to move forward with a similar proposal, the STABLE  Act, and President Donald Trump has  indicated he wants to sign payment stablecoin legislation. Accordingly, payment  stablecoin legislation is poised to be enacted into law later this year.  
In this Legal Update, we answer key questions about the GENIUS  Act.

##### What is a Payment Stablecoin?  
The GENIUS Act would define a payment stablecoin as a digital  asset that is or is designed to be used as a means of payment or settlement if:  (i) the issuer is obligated to convert, redeem, or repurchase for a fixed  amount of monetary value; (ii) it will maintain a stable value relative to the  value of a fixed amount of monetary value; and (iii) it is not a national  currency, bank deposit, interest-bearing instrument, or a security under  federal securities laws (other than by virtue of being a bond, note, evidence  of indebtedness, or investment contract).

##### Who can Issue Payment Stablecoins?  
To qualify as a permitted payment stablecoin issuers, a  person would have to incorporate in the US and then be either:  
- A federal qualified nonbank payment stablecoin  issuer that have been approved by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  (OCC) pursuant to terms set forth in the Act.
- A subsidiary of an insured depository  institution that has been approved by the depository institution’s primary  federal regulator (e.g., the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  (“Federal Reserve”) for state member banks) pursuant to terms set forth in the  Act.
- A state qualified payment stablecoin issuer that  have been approved by a state payment stablecoin regulator.

##### What are the Requirements for Becoming a Permitted  Payment Stablecoin Issuer?  
The Act sets forth the terms by which federal banking  regulators can approve a person to become a permitted payment stablecoin  issuer. These include that the applicant demonstrates its financial  condition and appropriate resources, provides background information on officers,  directors and principal shareholders, and satisfies any other relevant safety  and soundness factors established by the federal banking regulators.  
A federal regulator would have no more than 120 days to  issue a decision on an application and could deny an application if it  determined that the activities of the applicant would be unsafe or unsound  based on its ability to satisfy the prudential requirements discussed below.

##### What are the Benefits of Becoming a Permitted Payment  Stablecoin Issuer?  
The issuance of payment stablecoins in the US would be  restricted to the three types of permitted payment stablecoin issuers indicated  above. Although a payment stablecoin that is not issued by a permitted payment  stablecoin issuer still could be owned and sold in the US, the GENIUS Act would  prohibit it from being treated as cash or a cash equivalent for accounting,  securities margin, or derivatives purposes, or used as a settlement asset for  wholesale payments between banking organizations or by payment infrastructure  for settlement among banking organizations. These limitations will create strong  incentive for payment stablecoin issuers to become permitted payment stablecoin  issuers in the United States. However, even an unlicensed, non-US payment  stablecoin issuer must comply with a US court order or agency action. Such  orders and actions could direct the non-US issuer to seize, freeze, burn, or  prevent the transfer of a payment stablecoin.  
Further, under the GENIUS Act, the Treasury Department may  determine that a non-US issuer (that is not a permitted payment stablecoin  issuer) of any payment stablecoins trading in the United States has failed to  comply with a court order or agency action. If the foreign issuer does not come  into compliance with the order or action, then the Secretary of the Treasury  may issue a notice prohibiting digital asset service providers from  facilitating secondary trading of the foreign issuer’s payment stablecoins in  the United States. This would effectively block the non-US issuer from having  US customers own or trade its payment stablecoins.

##### What are the Requirements for Issuing Payment  Stablecoins?  
Payment stablecoin issuers would be required to comply with several  standards for the issuance of payment stablecoins. These include:  
- Reserves. Issuers would be required to maintain reserves backing their payment stablecoins on at least a 1:1 basis. Acceptable reserves would include US coins and currency, deposits with Federal Reserve Banks, demand deposits at insured depository institutions, Treasury bills, notes, or bonds with a maturity of 93 days or less, certain repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, and money market funds. Reserves could be tokenized or held in their “natural” form.
- However,  the GENIUS Act explicitly states that the requirement to maintain reserves does  not mean a payment stablecoin issuer would or would not be eligible for a  Master Account at a Federal Reserve Bank.
- Public Reserves Disclosure. Monthly  disclosures of the composition of reserves, including the total number of  outstanding payment stablecoins and the amount and composition of the reserves,  would need to be published on the issuer’s website. A payment stablecoin  issuer’s public reserve disclosure would need to be examined on a monthly basis  by a registered public accounting firm, and the CEO and CFO of the issuer would  need to certify the accuracy of the disclosure to the relevant federal or state  regulator. Payment stablecoin issuers that have more than $50 billion in consolidated  total outstanding issuance and are not SEC reporting companies would be  required to obtain an annual audit of their financial statements (which must  cover related party transactions) and disclose that information on their  website and to their primary federal banking regulator.
- Redemption Procedures and Disclosure. Issuers  would be required to establish procedures for timely redemption of outstanding  payment stablecoins and publicly disclose their redemption policy.  
Payment stablecoin issuers generally would be prohibited  from pledging, rehypothecating, or reusing reserves, except for satisfying  related margin or custody services obligations or creating liquidity to meet  redemption requests. Issuers also would be prohibited from conditioning their  payment stablecoin services on a customer’s agreement to obtain another paid  service from the issuer (or its affiliates) or abstain from obtaining service  from a competitor.  
Payment stablecoin issuers also would need to comply with  appropriate capital, liquidity, reserve asset diversification, and interest  rate risk management requirements, as well as appropriately tailored  operational, compliance, and information technology risk management standards.  The capital requirements would not be subject to the limitations of the  Dodd-Frank Act’s Collins Amendment, which prohibits regulators from setting  lower capital standards than were in effect for banks in 2010.

##### How are Non-Stablecoin Activities Regulated  
Similar to banks and bank holding companies, the  non-stablecoin-related businesses of a payment stablecoin issuer would be  restricted. Specifically, a payment stablecoin issuer would be permitted to  only: (i) issue and redeem payment stablecoins; (ii) manage reserves related to  the payment stablecoins; (iii) provide custodial and safekeeping services  related to payment stablecoins; and (iv) undertake other functions that  directly support the work of issuing and redeeming payment stablecoins.  However, a payment stablecoin issuer’s regulator could authorize it to engage  in other activities. The holding company of a payment stablecoin issuer and  “sister” affiliates would not be restricted with respect to their business  activities or relationships.

##### Who Supervises Permitted Payment Stablecoins Issuers?  
Federal qualified nonbank payment stablecoin issuers would  be regulated and supervised exclusively by the OCC, the current supervisor of  national banks. A federal qualified nonbank payment stablecoin issuer would be  required to submit quarterly financial condition and compliance reports and  undergo examination by the OCC. The OCC would have exclusive regulatory and  supervisory authority over a federal qualified nonbank payment stablecoin  issuer. This may indicate that state licensing requirements, such as money  transmitter and trust company laws, would be preempted for federal qualified  nonbank payment stablecoin issuers.  
Payment stablecoin issuers that are subsidiaries of insured  depository institutions would be regulated and supervised by the federal  regulator of the insured depository institution (e.g., Federal Reserve, with  respect to subsidiaries of state member banks).  
Payment stablecoin issuers with consolidated total  outstanding issuance of payment stablecoins of $10 billion or less (and which  are not a subsidiary of an insured depository institution) could opt to be  regulated and supervised under a state stablecoin framework, provided that the  state framework is substantially similar to the federal framework. This means  that states will need to update their regulatory frameworks as the GENIUS Act  is implemented to ensure they reflect the new federal requirements. Further, a  state regulator could enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to share  supervision of that state’s stablecoin issuers with the federal authority.  
Payment stablecoin issuers with consolidated total  outstanding issuance in excess of $10 billion would be required to directly  comply with federal stablecoin regulations unless granted a waiver by a federal  banking regulator. State stablecoin issuers that are non-depository  institutions would become jointly regulated and supervised by their state regulator  and one of the federal banking regulators, but would not need to convert to a  federal charter. State stablecoin issuers that are depository institutions  would become jointly regulated and supervised by their state regulator and one  of the federal banking regulators.

No. The GENIUS Act would explicitly exclude payment  stablecoins from the federal regulatory regimes for securities, commodities,  and investment companies. Payment stablecoins would be excluded from the  definition of “security” under federal securities laws, the definition of  “commodity” in the Commodity Exchange Act, and the definition of an “investment  company” under the Investment Company Act.

##### Do States have Jurisdiction over Payment Stablecoins?  
Federal qualified nonbank payment stablecoin issuers would  not be subject to state supervision or regulation, which is similar to the  treatment of national banks under the National Bank Act. It appears that  approved subsidiaries of insured depository institutions would not be subject  to state supervision or regulation, although this is not clearly stated in the  Act.  
For state qualified payment stablecoin issuers, the GENIUS  Act would require state regulators to establish criteria for determining  whether a state regulatory regime is substantially similar to the federal  regulatory framework for stablecoins. States would need to certify on an annual  basis to the federal Secretary of the Treasury that their regimes satisfy those  criteria. If a state fails to submit an annual certification or the Secretary  of the Treasury rejects a certification, then that state’s payment stablecoin  issuers would become subject to the federal regulatory framework for  stablecoins, regardless of market capitalization.  
A payment stablecoin issuer regulated by a state generally  would be subject to the consumer protection laws of that state. Other states  could impose consumer protection requirements on an out-of-state  state-regulated payment stablecoin issuer only to the extent states may impose  such requirements on an out-of-state federal qualified nonbank payment  stablecoin issuer (i.e., only if the consumer protection requirement would not  be preempted by federal law). This preemption provision does not appear to  protect a state-regulated payment stablecoin issuer from other states’ money  transmitter licensing requirements.  
State regulators (and federal regulators) would be able to  bring enforcement actions against their payment stablecoin issuers and  affiliated parties that are similar to the actions they may bring against  analogous insured depository institutions and their affiliated parties.

  context_and_implications: The GENIUS Act aims to create a cohesive regulatory framework for stablecoins, balancing federal and state oversight. It ensures that state regulations align with federal standards, potentially centralizing control and simplifying compliance for issuers. This could lead to a more uniform regulatory environment for stablecoins across the United States.
  outcomes: State payment stablecoin issuers must comply with federal standards or be subject to federal regulation. State and federal regulators can enforce consumer protection laws and take action against issuers.

##### What are the AML Requirements for Permitted Stablecoin  Issuers?  
Payment stablecoin issuers would be expressly classified as  financial institutions for purposes of the federal Bank Secrecy Act. This would  subject them to the full range of anti-money laundering (“AML”) compliance  obligations, including customer identification and due diligence, although  FinCEN would be required to implement compliance rules that are tailored to the  size and complexity of the issuer.  
Further, the risk management standards established by  federal banking regulators would be required to include AML and sanctions  compliance. In particular, payment stablecoin issuers also would be required to  have the technological capacity to effectively block a digital asset of a  non-US person pursuant to a court order or agency action.

##### What Happens if a Payment Stablecoin Issuer Fails?  
The GENIUS Act would amend the Bankruptcy Code to permit a  payment stablecoin issuer that is not a depository institution to be a debtor.  This would allow a federal qualified nonbank payment stablecoin issuer,  subsidiary of an insured depository institution, or state qualified payment  stablecoin issuer that is not a bank or trust company to declare bankruptcy.  Stablecoin issuers that are depository institutions, such as banks or trust  companies, would be resolved either by the FDIC (for insured depository  institutions) or under state insolvency law (for uninsured state-chartered  depository institutions).  
The GENIUS Act would amend and supersede existing insolvency  laws (e.g., Bankruptcy Code) by establishing that a person holding payment  stablecoins issued by an insolvent stablecoin issuer would have priority over  all other claims against the issuer. This would apply to both insolvencies  under federal insolvency laws and state insolvency laws, superseding any state  claims priority to the contrary.

##### What’s the Authority for Banks to Provide Services for  Payment Stablecoins?  
The Act addresses the provision of banking services for  payment stablecoins in two ways.  
First, a person would be able to offer custodial or safekeeping  services for permitted payment stablecoins or private keys of permitted  stablecoins only if (i) the person is supervised or regulated by a federal or  state banking regulator, and (ii) the person complies with segregation  requirements imposed under federal banking, securities, or derivatives law.  Such requirements generally could not include obligations to maintain  additional loss reserves or capital for such custodial and safekeeping services  (i.e., no reimposition of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s SAB 121).  
Second and more broadly, the GENIUS Act would implicitly  recognize that a federal or state depository institution, credit union, or  trust company has the authority to engage in certain digital asset-related  activities, including:  
- accepting or receiving deposits and issuing  digital assets that represent deposits;
- utilizing a distributed ledger for the books and  records of the entity and to affect intrabank transfers; and
- providing custodial services for payment stablecoins,  private keys of payment stablecoins, or reserves backing payment stablecoins.
